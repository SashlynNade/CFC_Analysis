As a fan of Chelsea Football Club, I wanted to challenge myself, by analysing and documenting the clubs Premier League success between 2000/2001-2017/2018. I will be showcasing my data analytical skills by breaking down a dataset found on Kagggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saife245/english-premier-league?resource=download). To break down the dataset found, I have utilised Python and other libraries such as Pandas and MatPlotlib to transform the data and present it to be visually friendly to users. The repository will also contain an analytical breakdown to the data I have pulled from Kaggle and documentation for the processes used to extract, clean and transform the data.
