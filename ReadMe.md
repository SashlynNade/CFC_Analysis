# Who are Chelsea Football Club?
Chelsea Football Club (CFC), is a professional fooball (soccer) clubs based in London, England. The club was founded in 1905, and has seemingly become one of the most successful and supported teams in the world. The club's iconic blue colors adorn the passionate Stamford Bridge stadium, their home ground, where they showcase thrilling football under the guidance of top-tier managers and skilled players. Over the last 20 years, Chelsea Fc has been one of the most dominate teams at a domestic and international level, with the club wining 6 Premier League seaons, 8 FA Cups, 5 League Cups, 4 FA Community Shields, 2 UEFA CHampions Leagues, 2 Europa League, 1 Club World Cup and 2 UEFA Super Cups.

# Why I started this project!
As a fan of Chelsea Football Club, I wanted to challenge myself, by analysing and documenting the clubs Premier League success between 2000/2001-2017/2018. I will be showcasing my data analytical skills by breaking down a dataset found on Kaggle, which can also be found within the repository. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saife245/english-premier-league?resource=download). To break down the dataset found, I have utilised Python and other libraries such as Pandas and MatPlotlib to transform the data and present it to be visually friendly to users. 

# What is the objective behind the project?
For my inaugural project, I aimed for simplicity with an engaging touch. My focus was on employing Python, a tool known for its interactive features. I conducted basic data manipulation, from which included data extraction, cleaning and transformation. I opted for Python, specifically its access to libraries such as Pandas and MatPlotLib, due to its captivating statistical analysis and modelling, allowing me to showcase my findings in a visually appealing and enjoyable manner.

# What did I learn?
1. Technical Skills Acquired:
    - ** Data Analysis with Python:** Although I had a brief introduction to Python during my university days, I dedicated considerable time to researching how to manipulate data effectively with Python. My research led me to discover key libraries that were well-suited for this project. Through hands-on exploration, I gained proficiency in utilizing Pandas for managing data frames and Matplotlib for data visualization. This experience not only enhanced my understanding of Python's capabilities but also empowered me to apply these tools efficiently in real-world data analysis tasks.
      
    - **Data Cleaning with Excel:** One of the key takeaways from this project was my deepened understanding of data cleaning techniques using Excel. Initially, I grappled with messy and inconsistent datasets, but through careful exploration and experimentation, I mastered various tools and functions within Excel to cleanse the data effectively. I learned how to identify and handle missing values, employing techniques such as conditional formatting to highlight gaps in the dataset. Additionally, I became proficient in using Excel's sorting and filtering functions to organize large datasets, making it easier to spot anomalies and inconsistencies. Utilizing functions like VLOOKUP and IF statements, I was able to cross-reference and validate data, ensuring accuracy in my analyses. The process of data cleaning in Excel not only enhanced the quality of my dataset but also provided me with a valuable skill set that I can apply to future projects, ensuring that I work with reliable, high-quality data for meaningful analyses.

2. Project Management:
    - **Time Management:** Throughout the duration of this project, I honed my time management skills significantly. Juggling research, and learning new tools like Python was a challenging yet rewarding     experience. Setting clear milestones and deadlines allowed me to break down the project into manageable tasks. I learned to prioritize activities based on their importance and deadline, ensuring             that I focused my energy on high-impact tasks first. Additionally, I became proficient in estimating the time required for different project components, and also gained invaluable skills in time             management that I can apply to future endeavors.

# Limitations
Reflecting on this project, I encountered several limitations that served as valuable learning opportunities. One notable challenge was my limited prior experience with Python, which led to a steep learning curve at the project's outset. Navigating these tools required extensive research and hands-on practice, consuming more time than initially anticipated. Additionally, the availability of quality data posed a constraint. The dataset's scope and depth, while informative, had certain gaps, limiting the depth of analysis possible. Moreover, time constraints influenced the depth to which I could explore advanced techniques within Python. These limitations taught me the importance of setting realistic expectations, planning for unforeseen challenges, and continuously adapting my approach based on the project's evolving needs. In retrospect, these constraints reinforced the significance of resourceful problem-solving, adaptability, and the necessity of considering limitations as inherent aspects of any project, each providing a unique chance for growth and improvement in future endeavors.
